Things I want my tour software to do (purely for my own use, not as a product):
>Generate brackets for swiss stage
>Calculate optimal number of rounds, based on minimum  number of rounds desired and how many players progress through to elimination stage (aim to minimise tiebreaks)
>Calculate countback and use it for seeding
>Generate graphical output for each round's matchups
>Store player info (Name, alias[username], [notes]teams used)
>Save all results
>Save all info about tour to .tour file (or something like that)
>Export tournament data to a database (may need to provide framework of how db is set up, also what kind of db it is)
>Also display some data as a spreadsheet (data grid)

Long term goals
>Support for all common formats (single/double elim, RR)
>Support for group stages
>Support for flexible multi-stage tours

Current task:
Maybe tab between first and second stages
Setting up tour- want to have an add player form, where I add all the info necessary for a new player.
Also want to display players already registered, and the number of participants
Option to view player info
Option to preview point distribution/bracket. Use this to determine no. of rounds
Option to set number of rounds
Option to close signups
